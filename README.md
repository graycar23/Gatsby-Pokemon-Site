Basic Pokedex Site created through JavaScript, React, and Gatsby.

The basis of the page was a basic home page made earlier through Gatsby's Tutorial

The main home page contains an example of a pie chart that can be randomized with the button next to it.

There is a basic about page.

There is also a blog page with blog posts rendered as mdx files, though this is not part of the specific pokemon functionality.

The path /pokemon will take you to a page showing the sprites of ten pokemon along with their names and their stats.

If you got to /pokemon/{specific pokemon name}, you will go to a page just showing that specific pokemon and their stats. It should have a pie chart, but it doesn't show up for some reason.

Here is a link to Github Pages, though I had an error deploying it: https://graycar23.github.io/Gatsby-Pokemon-Site/
